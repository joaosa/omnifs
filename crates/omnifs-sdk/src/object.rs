//! Object model: typed canonical resources addressed by typed keys.
//!
//! An [`Object`] is a value parsed from one canonical upstream payload (a
//! GitHub issue, an arXiv paper); its [`Key`] knows how to fetch that
//! payload and what logical identity it has. Register the pair on an
//! object route and the SDK handles the cache protocol: it emits
//! canonical-store effects on fresh loads, re-renders from host-pushed
//! canonical bytes on warm reads, and answers conditional reloads through
//! the `since` validator. The provider's only upstream-facing code is
//! [`Key::load`].
