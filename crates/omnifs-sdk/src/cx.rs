//! Handler execution context and callout batching.
//!
//! [`Cx<State>`](Cx) is what an async handler holds: typed provider state
//! plus the operation's callout machinery. Awaiting a callout future pushes
//! the callout onto the yield queue and suspends; the runtime drains the
//! queue after every poll and hands the batch to the host, which runs it
//! concurrently and resumes the operation with results in batch order.
//! Every callout is strictly request/response: each one yielded expects
//! exactly one typed result back, matched positionally, not by id.
//!
//! [`join_all`] exploits that protocol to fan out N callout futures in one
//! suspension round instead of N sequential round trips. The positional
//! matching is also its sharp edge: every child must belong to the same
//! `Cx` and yield exactly one callout per suspension, or sibling results
//! silently misalign (see [`join_all`]).
