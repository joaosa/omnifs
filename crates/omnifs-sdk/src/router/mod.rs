//! The declarative provider router (ADR-0001 §10).
//!
//! A provider's `start` registers its whole path surface imperatively on a
//! [`Router`]; afterwards the `#[omnifs_sdk::provider]` macro glue calls
//! [`Router::seal`] (overlapping leaf claims fail initialization) and drives
//! every host browse call (`lookup_child`, `list_children`, `read_file`,
//! `open_file`) through the table. There are no per-route attribute macros.
//!
//! Registration verbs:
//!
//! - [`Router::dir`]: a directory route; the handler returns a
//!   [`crate::projection::DirProjection`].
//! - [`Router::file`]: a file route; the handler returns a
//!   [`crate::projection::FileProjection`].
//! - [`Router::treeref`]: a subtree handoff; the handler returns a
//!   [`crate::handler::TreeRef`] the host resolves to a bind-mounted tree.
//! - [`Router::object`] / [`Router::file_object`] / [`Router::attach`]: bind a
//!   typed [`crate::object::Object`] whose [`crate::object::Key`] both loads
//!   and identifies the canonical resource; representations and field leaves
//!   are declared in a [`DirObjectBlock`] / [`FileObjectBlock`].
//!
//! Route templates are absolute paths built from literal segments,
//! `{capture}` segments, prefix captures (`@{resolver}`, `v{version}`), and
//! an optional trailing `{*rest}` multi-segment capture. The `pattern`
//! submodule owns the exact grammar and the precedence order dispatch uses.
//!
//! Contracts a route author can rely on:
//!
//! - Every literal prefix of a registered route is auto-navigable. Never
//!   write a stub handler just so `/a` exists on the way to `/a/{b}/c`.
//! - A capture parse rejection removes that route from candidacy; dispatch
//!   falls through to the next-most-specific matching route, not to
//!   not-found.
//! - `lookup_child` is the authoritative name oracle; `list_children` may be
//!   non-exhaustive, and a name absent from the latest listing can still
//!   resolve through lookup.
//! - Listings merge the handler's enumeration with the literal sibling
//!   routes registered at that depth, and report `exhaustive = false`
//!   whenever a capture sibling exists at the next depth.
