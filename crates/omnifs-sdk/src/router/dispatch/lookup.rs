    /// 1. A treeref route at the child path: run the handler and hand the
    ///    subtree to the host.
    /// 2. A dir route at the child path: answer statically, without running
    ///    the child's handler, unless a file route also matches with
    ///    strictly higher precedence (then the file claims the name).
    /// 3. An object anchored at the child path: a dir-shaped anchor answers
    ///    as a static directory; a file-shaped one as its file entry.
    /// 4. A representation or field leaf of an object anchored at the
    ///    parent.
    /// 5. A file route at the child path: answer statically.
    /// 6. An auto-navigable literal prefix: a directory synthesized from the
    ///    route table alone.
    /// 7. Fallback: run the parent's dir handler with
    ///    [`DirIntent::Lookup`] and resolve the name against its enumeration
    ///    merged with static siblings; this is how dynamically enumerated
    ///    children (which match no route of their own) resolve.
    ///
    /// Static answers carry their sibling entries and an `exhaustive` flag
    /// that is false whenever a capture sibling exists at this depth, so the
    /// host knows the names it cached are not the whole story.
