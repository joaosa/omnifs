//! Typed async Git callout builders.
//!
//! `cx.git().open_repo(cache_key, clone_url).await` issues a `git-open-repo`
//! callout: the host checks `clone_url` against the provider's capability
//! grants, clones the remote into a host-side cache directory if it is not
//! already there, and returns a `GitRepoInfo` whose `tree` field is the
//! handle a treeref route returns (wrap it in
//! [`crate::handler::TreeRef::new`]). The repository bytes never enter guest
//! memory: traversal and file reads are served through FUSE bind mounts of
//! the clone directory, not through the WIT.
//!
//! `cache_key` names the clone directory and must be a safe relative path:
//! slash-separated, no leading `/`, no `.` or `..` components, no NUL.
//! Repeating a key reuses the existing clone without refetching; a key
//! already bound to a different `clone_url` is an error rather than a silent
//! overwrite. Pick a key that is stable per repository, such as
//! `github.com/<owner>/<repo>`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let opened = cx
//!     .git()
//!     .open_repo(
//!         format!("github.com/{owner}/{repo}"),
//!         format!("git@github.com:{owner}/{repo}.git"),
//!     )
//!     .await?;
//! Ok(TreeRef::new(opened.tree))
